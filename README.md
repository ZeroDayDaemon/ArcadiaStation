Arcadia Station is a fork of Space Station 14 with a focus on player expression and customization, to create an extensive roleplay enviorment.

[Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a homegrown engine written in C#.
In order to prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.
